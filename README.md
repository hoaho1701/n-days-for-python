# N-Days-for-Python

## Objective
The **N-Days-for-Python** project aims to provide a series of exercises and practical projects to learn Python over multiple days. Each day focuses on a specific topic or problem to improve Python programming skills.

## Content
Below are the exercises for each day:

### Day 1: Hangman Game
- A classic Hangman game where the player guesses letters to find the correct word before running out of attempts.
- Uses a random word list.
- Displays game status using ASCII Art.

### Day 2: Caesar Cipher
- Implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm.
- Allows users to enter text and shift letters accordingly.
- Supports running the program multiple times.

### Day 3: Secret Auction
- A program that allows multiple users to place secret bids.
- Determines the winner with the highest bid.
- Supports user input for names and bid amounts.

### Day 4: Simple Calculator
- Builds a calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Stores previous calculation results for further operations.
- Supports looping for multiple calculations.
